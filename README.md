📘 QwenRAG-PDF-Search

Ask questions from your PDFs — with real citations and instant context retrieval

QwenRAG-PDF-Search enables users to upload one or multiple PDF documents and interact with them using natural language.
It utilises Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to return accurate, context-aware answers with source citations, combining semantic search from ChromaDB with Qwen2.5 LLMs.

🔹 Problem

Professionals waste valuable time searching through long PDF reports, research papers, and manuals to find information. Traditional search (Ctrl + F) doesn’t handle synonyms or complex questions.

🔹 Solution

This project transforms static document reading into an interactive conversation:

          1️PDFs are uploaded and automatically chunked
          2️Text is embedded with SentenceTransformers
          3️Embeddings stored in ChromaDB for semantic retrieval
          4️Retrieved context is passed to Qwen2.5 via LangChain
          5️The LLM answers while showing exact page citations

🚀 Key Features

        ✔ Upload multiple PDFs
        ✔ Semantic search for improved accuracy
        ✔ Context-aware answers with source text
        ✔ Select model size: 1.5B / 3B / 7B
        ✔ Clean and fast Gradio chat interface
        ✔ Fully local workflow (depending on model used)
